## Backgound
This project is from our MSDA program at UTSA.  Our original challenge was to find a real-world problem that impacts us and use data driven methodologies to find a solution to the problem.
  1. Identify a problem.
  2. Find a real-world data set to solve it
  3. Survey prior literature to look at other attempts to solve this problem
  4. Build and iterate on your solution.
  5. Generate and refine conclusions
