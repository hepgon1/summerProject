Main is on the bottom of this file. 

64M records in the file.
83K for one anime show (21)

## Process the user to anime file. 
There are 64Mil rows in the file.  We cannot read it into memory in it's entirity.  
We plan to run this with a few randomly sampled anime ids so that we can create a sample of the data. 
```{r}
prc.usr.anime.file = function(rc, wd){
  # how many rows to count and the skip for the for loop.
  rowcnt= rc
  skp = 0
  
  #How many times to run the loop based upon the size of the file
  loop.number = ceiling(64000000/rowcnt)
  
  #The files that we are going to read and write, Shortens the code below.
  usr.anime.file = paste0(wd, "/myAnimeList Dataset/extracted data/UserAnimeList.csv")
  wrt.usr.anime.file = paste0(wd,"/code/output/MycleanUserAnimeList.csv")
  
  #Read the file and process rowcnt number of rows to pull an anime from the list of users. 
  for (i in 1:5){
    if(i==1){
      pr = read.csv(usr.anime.file, nrows = rowcnt, skip = skp, header = T)
      write.table(pr[which(pr[,2] == 21),], wrt.usr.anime.file, append = T, sep = ",", col.names = T, row.names = F)
